Hey all, I wanted to let you know that we are planning on starting back up in March. I and my family have been dealing with the flu and I haven't had as much time to get things going again for a next meet. I hope to see all of you at our March meeting. I am tentatively scheduling it for the 3rd Thursday of March (21st). Also, if you haven't signed up for Barcamp Conway do so now. I look forward to seeing you all there.

Cheers,

Derrick Koon
