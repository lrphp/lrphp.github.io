Skimming through the Zend manual today I found an answer to a question I have had for a while...

Q: Why do some programmers leave the closing PHP tag out of pure php files?

A: So the interpreter doesn't have to switch back to html and so that no whitespace is created at the end of the file that could jank up an include before a header declaration...

> The closing tag of a PHP block at the end of a file is optional, and in some cases omitting it is helpful when using include() or require(), so unwanted whitespace will not occur at the end of files, and you will still be able to add headers to the response later. It is also handy if you use output buffering, and would not like to see added unwanted whitespace at the end of the parts generated by the included files.

Just a little tip for anybody wondering why the hell some people would do that...
