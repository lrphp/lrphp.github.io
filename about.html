The Little Rock PHP Users Group is a group of people who are passionate about programming and furthering the teaching and implementation of PHP on the web. We come from diverse backgrounds but each brings an appreciation for the power of PHP as a language. We want to work in the community to help people who may be struggling to learn PHP or may need guidance on the usage of the language. We invite everyone to join and look forward to creating the web together.
